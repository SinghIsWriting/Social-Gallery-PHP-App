# Social Gallery

A feature-rich social media web application where users can upload and share images, like, comment, and interact with others in a visual gallery. Registered users can connect with each other, share their work, and communicate via a contact form. The project is built using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, with a responsive design for modern web browsers.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 7.4+**
- **MySQL/MariaDB**
- **Composer** (for managing PHP dependencies)
- **XAMPP/WAMP** or similar web server environment
- **Git** (optional but recommended)

### Clone the Repository

To start, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SinghIsWriting/Social-Gallery-PHP-App.git
cd Social-Gallery-PHP-App
```

### Setup
* Install Dependencies
Open a terminal in your project directory and run:
```
composer install
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in composer.json.

* Create an `.env` File
Copy the .env.example file (if it exists) or create a new .env file in the root of your project directory:
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Open the .env file and fill in your database and other credentials:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_DATABASE=social_gallery
DB_PORT=3306
```

* Load Environment Variables in PHP
Make sure your project is loading the .env file using vlucas/phpdotenv. Check the db_connect.php file to ensure that environment variables are correctly accessed (see previous steps for loading .env).

### Database Setup

* Ensure MySQL Apache is running (e.g., through XAMPP or WAMP).
* Access `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` and login.
* Create the database in MySQL:
```
CREATE DATABASE social_gallery;
```
* Create required tables to store data using following sql commands:
```
-- Add Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add images table
CREATE TABLE images (
  id int(11) NOT NULL,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  description text DEFAULT NULL,
  image_path varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  uploaded_on timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Add likes table
CREATE TABLE likes (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    image_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (image_id) REFERENCES images(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    UNIQUE KEY unique_like (image_id, user_id)
);

-- Add comments table
CREATE TABLE comments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    image_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    comment TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (image_id) REFERENCES images(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE contact_us (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    submission_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

ALTER TABLE contact_us ADD COLUMN registered_mail ENUM('yes', 'no') DEFAULT 'no';

```
